### CPSC 210: Personal Project

# *- Adventure -*

Welcome to my adventurous project! The name itself doesn't quite do its job in explaining what the application does— 
dive in with me about the details!

+ ***Why** is this project of interest?*  
Indecisiveness is a common disease— hard to cure and limits the excitement that an adventurous choice can bring. The 
idea of this project sprouts from the fact that I am also a major victim of the disease. If someONE can't make the 
decision for me, why not someTHING?


+ ***What** will the application do?*  
This application uses the power of randomness to help the users make adventurous choices. From the next restaurant to 
visit, to the next hiking location, the user is able to keep track of the possible adventures they might want to try 
in the future. When it is time to make a decision, it takes a list of choices, and generates a decision for the user. 


+ ***Who** will use the application?*  
From children, to adults, anyone is free to go on their *Adventure*! The application is open for those who craves 
a little thrill in their choices.
